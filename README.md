# Math Wizards
The premise to this game is simple. There is a random number that you are trying to get close to using 2 numbers, but the math functions performed upon your two guessed numbers are random. For example, if you guess 2 & 2, the result may either be 4 (addition), 4 (multiplication), 0 (substraction), or 1 (division). 

# Todo
+ Clean up the code a bit
+ Add an option to let the player choose the random number range  (right now the default is 0-100 noninclusive)
+ Provide support for both multiplayer and singleplayer 
+ Add the option to select the amount of rounds (right now the default is 10 rounds)
+ Add magnitude of correctness instead of 1 point per win/tie (i.e. the closer to the random number, the more points earned)
+ Create a GUI
+ Add online support for two players
+ Add online support for more than 2 players per game
